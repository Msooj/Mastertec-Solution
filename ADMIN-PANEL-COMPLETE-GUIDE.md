Add this to each product card in admin view:

  <button 
    className="btn-edit"
    onClick={() => startEdit(product)}
  >
    <FiEdit2 /> Edit
  </button>
  <button 
    className="btn-delete"
    onClick={() => {
      if (window.confirm('Delete this product?')) {
        removeProduct(product.id);
      }
    }}
  >
    <FiTrash2 /> Delete
  </button>
