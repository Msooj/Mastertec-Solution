## ðŸŽ‰ What's Fixed

### 1. âœ… Auth Persistence - Stay Logged In
**Problem:** Users were logged out when refreshing the page

**Solution:**
- Added session check on app mount
- Listens for auth state changes
- Automatically restores user session from Supabase
- Admin status is also restored

**How it works:**
- When you refresh, the app checks if there's an active Supabase session
- If found, it automatically logs you back in
- No need to re-enter credentials!

---

### 2. âœ… Remove Items from Cart
**Problem:** No way to remove items once added to cart

**Solution:**
- Added red âœ• button next to each cart item
- Click to remove that specific item
- Cart total updates automatically

**How to use:**
1. Add items to cart
2. Click cart icon
3. Click the red âœ• button next to any item to remove it

### 3. âœ… Flying Cart Animation
**Problem:** No visual feedback when adding to cart

**Solution:**
- Added smooth flying animation
- ðŸ›’ emoji flies from product to cart icon
- Fades out and shrinks during animation
- Takes 0.8 seconds

**How it looks:**
- Click "Add to Cart" on any product
- Watch the cart icon fly from the button to the cart
- Smooth, professional animation!

### 4. âœ… Demo Products Order Fix
**Problem:** Orders failed with demo products (string IDs)

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

### Auth Persistence Code:

useEffect(() => {
  const checkSession = async () => {

    if (session?.user) {
      setCurrentUser(session.user);
      if (session.user.user_metadata?.role === 'admin') {
        setIsAdmin(true);
      }
    }
  };
  checkSession();
  
  // Listen for auth changes
  const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
    if (session?.user) {
      setCurrentUser(session.user);
    } else {
      setCurrentUser(null);
      setIsAdmin(false);
    }
  });
  
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```
