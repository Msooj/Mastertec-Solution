# Instructions to fix the product loading issue

It appears the application's backend server is not running. The frontend application cannot load products without it.

Please follow these steps to start the backend server:

1.  **Open a new terminal** on your computer.
2.  **Navigate to the backend directory** by running this command:
    ```
    cd c:\Users\user\Desktop\SOLUTION\backend
    ```
3.  **Install the necessary dependencies** by running:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the server** by running:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

You should see a message saying `🚀 Backend server running on http://localhost:5000`.

Once the backend server is running, please **refresh your web application**. The products should now load correctly.
