# 🔧 IMPORTANT: Your App is Using the OLD Backend!

## The Problem

Your `mastertec-new-clean/src/App.js` file is still using:
- ❌ `axios` for HTTP requests
- ❌ `API_URL = "http://localhost:5000"` (local backend)
- ❌ NOT using Supabase for data operations

This is why:
- You get logged out on refresh (no Supabase auth persistence)
- No flying animation (old code)
- Can't remove cart items (old code)

## The Solution

I need to update your App.js to use Supabase AND add all the fixes.

Let me create a completely new App.js file with:
1. ✅ Supabase for all operations
2. ✅ Auth persistence (stay logged in)
3. ✅ Remove from cart button
4. ✅ Flying animation

## What I'll Do

I'll create a backup of your current App.js and then replace it with the Supabase version that has all fixes included.

**Ready?** Let me know and I'll apply the complete update!
